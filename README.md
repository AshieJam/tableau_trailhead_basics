# Reflection
    One idea from the Data Storytelling with Tableau Public module that stood out to me was the importance of keeping a clear narrative, which guided how I designed my final visualization. From The Tableau Data Model module, I learned how Tableau uses relationships instead of traditional joins to preserve the correct level of detail when combining multiple tables. This matters in real healthcare settings, where patient data is often split into visits, labs, diagnoses, and even their care team.
